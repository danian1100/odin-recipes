The project "odin-recipes" involves building a basic recipe website to showcase everything I've learned regarding HTML.

The website consist of a main index page which will have the link to 3 different recipes.

Each of one has a image, a description, list of ingredients and the steps to make such recipe.

With this project I've shown that I'm able to set up the usual boilerplate HTML and that I can add links, images, headings and much more to the website.
